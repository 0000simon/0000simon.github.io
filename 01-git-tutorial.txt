Config git:
	git config --global user.name "some name of the user"
	git config --global user.email "some mail to "

Initializing a git project:
	cd "to the folder you want to use for version control"
	git init

Adding new files:
	- once inside the local repo ...
	- we write index.html
	git status
		- with this, git present the files in which it is aware, which:
			- tracked: files that git knows about and are added to the repository
			- untracked: file that are in you working directory, but not added to the repository.
	- to get git to track them you need to "stage" them, or add them to the stagging environment.


Stagging Environment:
	git add index.html	# to stage the file
	git status	# to se that git now is monitoring the file
	git add --all # add all the files to the stagging environoment, this will stage all changes (new, modified, delete)
	git status # to check the stagging
